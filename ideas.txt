Theme: Minimalism

- a 3D game in Unity and GameDraw.
- first-person point-and-click adventure
- minimalist graphics & sound
  - graphics = little-to-no texturing
  - sound = minimalist music, sound effects
- fixed-location camera, can rotate 360 on the Z axis
  - rotate camera on mouse at screen edge?
- terminals which you can access and use a command-line interface to act as the puzzles (kind of like Dunnet)
- some sort of thriller setting?



- will probably need to implement some sort of queueing system for the instructions to make scripting easier
	- that way, when displaying speech on screen, clicking to continue just pops off the next instruction from the queue
