Theme: Minimalism

- a 3D game in Unity and GameDraw.
- first-person point-and-click adventure
- minimalist graphics & sound
  - graphics = little-to-no texturing
  - sound = minimalist music, sound effects
- fixed-location camera, can rotate 360 on the Z axis
  - rotate camera on mouse at screen edge?
- terminals which you can access and use a command-line interface to act as the puzzles (kind of like Dunnet)
- some sort of thriller setting?


// Quartz MS Regular is font for clock


- model a guitar. Using it plays sound effect of recording of detuned guitar.

- Use() lightswitch:
  - move close to lightswitch
  - rotate top lightswitch to on position
  - turn lights on
  - back to original position
  - say "Much better"
  
  
- Need to fix apartment scripts now that I'm using transform.Rotate instead of transform.eulerAngles += etc.
