Scene 1:
 - you are at home in your apartment
 - alarm goes off * beep beep beep beep * x 2; eyes closed, black screen
 - blinking awake (fade in)
 - turn head to check time
 - you wake up in the morning to find a envelope sitting on the floor by the door
 - you open the envelope to find a USB stick
 - you insert it into your desktop and it reboots into some command prompt, asking for a login
 - you leave the login prompt (ESC), and the phone rings
 - a voice on the other line says something about needing to run (?) and the USB stick will help
 - knocking at the door from police/some secret-service-esque thing
 - go into command prompt
 - then do SSH into some other server to escape
   - how does the character know what other server? some file on the USB stick with some address?
