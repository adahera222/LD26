Morning (working title)
=========

Morning is a story-driven, 3D point-and-click adventure. A prototype was developed for Ludum Dare 26
(http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=9896). The theme for this jam was 
Minimalism, which I incorporated by choosing to have little-to-no texturing, and achieving all
graphical effects through the use of shaders only.
